I am new to the development world of online programming and engineering.

For sometime now I have been intrigued in designing my own product. 

I would like to become an engineer for something in the area of networking or possibly telecommunications. 

I have a strong passion for networking and telecommunications.

Only problem is, even if I can create a network on my own, and provide service and data to someones mobile device, 
I still can not express to the millions of people online to know that so I can grow doing what I like and best part,


 what i am.  



My passion has been alive for awhile and the only problem is I lack in the area of coding.


but to be an engineer (no I am not one and can not really speak on the behalf of engineers due to me not technically having the title at all but I am working my way there and from my perspective this is what I would say in my own opinion and not judging or saying that this opinion is correct or not it is only my thoughts so don't take it personally, it is not so much about coding, it's what about creating and putting what components, functionalities you would need to be able to even make that code and you would have to know a little bit more than coding, 
Or have an idea first, as to what you want to create.)


Now I do understand that those hardware components and that software does have to have code. So this is why I want to keep learning.


 however I have been currently actually creating my own website and this is the link to check it out this is what I've got so far and like I said my passion is still there has been there for some time and I just would like to transcribe what I can do and what I can't do all in one to be able to create something for myself like my own business product but I am continuing to learn and like I had mentioned here's my link to check out what I can do and what I have done this past week
